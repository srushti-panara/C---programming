# 🌟 My C Programming Journey 
Hello! 👋 <br>
I’m a beginner learning C programming, and this repository is where I practice, experiment, and grow as a programmer. <br>
Every program here is a small step toward understanding the world of coding, from printing “Hello World” to working with loops, arrays, and functions. <br>

## 🎯 What You’ll Find Here
**Fun experiments**: Little programs that make learning enjoyable. <br>
**Learning notes**: Every file has comments to help me (and you!) understand what’s happening. <br>
**Step-by-step growth**: From simple to slightly more challenging programs, all aimed at building confidence. <br>

## 💡 Why This Repo Exists
I believe programming is best learned by doing, breaking, and fixing. This repo is my personal playground where mistakes are welcome because that’s how real learning happens. <br>

## 🚀 My Goal
By the end of this repo, I hope to: <br>
Understand the basics of C programming. <br>
Write programs confidently without fear of errors. <br>
Build a foundation strong enough to tackle projects and problem-solving. <br>

## 🤝 Let’s Learn Together
If you’re also a beginner, feel free to explore the code, try it yourself, and even suggest improvements. We can learn and grow together! <br>
✨ Remember: Every expert programmer was once a beginner. Keep coding, keep experimenting, and have fun! <br>
